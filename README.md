# Java Design Patterns

Design Patterns are very popular among software developers. A design pattern is a well-described solution to
common software problem.

Some of benefits of using design patterns are :
  * Design patterns are already defined and provides industry standard approach to solve recurring problem,
    so it saves time if we  use  the design pattern .
  * Using design pattern promotes re-usability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code.
  * Since design patterns are already defined, it makes out code easy to understand and debug. It lead to faster development and new members of team understand it easily.

__Java Design Patterns__ are divided into tree parts : *Creational*, *Structural* and *Behavioral*.

## CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS

  Creational design pattens provide solution to instantiate an object in the best possible way for specific situations.
  The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add unwanted complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by __controlling the object creation__ by different ways.
  There are five creational design patterns that we will discuss on :

* Singleton Pattern
* Factory Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern
* Builder Pattern
* Prototype Pattern



## STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

 Structural Patterns provide different ways to create a class structure, for example using inheritance and composition
 to create a large object from small objects.
