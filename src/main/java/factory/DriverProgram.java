 * 
 * @description : The design pattern involves an interface(DeliveryNetwork) and its implementations.
 *                We also create a factory class ( DeliveryNetwork Factory) that creates the various
 *                objects. Also to demonstrate the program we create a driver program. 
 *                
 *                The Creation of the objects is abstracted from the driver program. The driver program 
 *                simply uses the factory to get various objects by using getDeliveryNetwork("type") method 
 *                for example: getDeliveryNetwork("Well");
 *
